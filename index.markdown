admin\_assistant is a Rails plugin that automates a lot of features typically needed in admin controllers. It is written and maintained by [Francis Hwang][fhwang].

## Features

* Built-in model creation, updating, and deletion.
* Live querying of models, which allows incremental development of controllers without the maintenance problems of generated code.
* Paginated indexes with built-in field-ordering.
* Highly customizable search that allows customization of individual fields, numerical comparators, and boolean operators.
* Built-in Ajax autocompleters for handling belongs-to associations.
* Built-in widgets for handling polymorphic belongs-to associations.
* Built-in support for images with [Paperclip](http://thoughtbot.com/projects/paperclip).
* Heavily hookable interface allows customization of columns, search parameters, form inputs, parameter handling, and model creation.

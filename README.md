admin_assistant is a Rails plugin that automates a lot of features typically
needed in admin interfaces. Current features include:

* Your basic CReate / Update / Delete
* Index with pagination and field ordering
* Search, either by all text fields or by specific fields
* Live querying of models to generate forms and indexes, meaning that adding
  new columns to your admin controllers is easy
* Simple handling of belongs_to association via drop-down selects
* Built-in support for Paperclip and FileColumn

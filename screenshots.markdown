<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen1.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="With a few lines of code, admin_assistant gives you a lot of default functionality for one model, including an index view with pagination and sorting, search, creating, and editing."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen1-thumb.png"></a>

<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen2.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="Sorting is built-in, and done in the URL for easy bookmarking, etc."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen2-thumb.png"></a>

<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen3.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="If there are many results, the pagination section will include a form for jumping to a specific page quickly."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen3-thumb.png"></a>

<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen4.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="By default, any boolean field on the model can be toggled in the index view with an Ajax link."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen4-thumb.png"></a>

<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen5.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="New and edit pages render default widgets for each column on the model. Datetime fields, for example, each get a &quot;Clear&quot; javascript link by default."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen5-thumb.png"></a>

<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen6.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="If the model has a belongs-to association, and there are too many records on that associated table to be usable in a dropdown, admin_assistant renders an autocompleter instead."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen6-thumb.png"></a>

<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen7.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="On the form, individual column inputs on the form can be overridden with custom logic. On this admin controller for the Product model, the column &quot;price&quot; is being rendered with the ERB template _price_input.html.erb. The submitted parameters are then pre-processed with a protected controller method called price_from_form."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen7-thumb.png"></a>

<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen8.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="A customized search form can give you searching by specific columns. The user can choose to match all or any of the conditions. Also, numerical fields include comparators by default, so, for example, you can search for all products costing greater than $100."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen8-thumb.png"></a>

<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen9.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="The same autocompleting for belongs-to associations is also available in the search form. In this example, the user is searching for blog posts by author."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen9-thumb.png"></a>

<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen10.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="There is an optional theme that mimics ActiveScaffold, which may come in handy if you're in the process of transitioning away from ActiveScaffold. admin_assistant does not conflict with ActiveScaffold; you can use the two in different controllers of the same Rails app."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen10-thumb.png"></a>

<a href="/admin_assistant/img/screen11.png" rel="lightbox[screens]" class="thumb" title="admin_assistant handles images out of the box through Paperclip."><img src="/admin_assistant/img/screen11-thumb.png"></a>
